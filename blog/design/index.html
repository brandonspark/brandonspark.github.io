<b>NOTE:</b> This post is a component of a larger reflection blog post on my
time as an instructor for CMU's 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming
course. That blog post can be found <a href="https://brandonspark.github.io/blog/teaching">here</a>.
</p>
<hr style="clear: both;"/>
<p>Designing a course from scratch is a lot of effort. It involves creating a
itinerary of topics, a comprehensive narrative that drives the material,
homework assignments that will be challenging enough to nurture students' growth
while remaining feasible, and a great deal of investment into each individual
student.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">this blog post is not about that</span>. Having finished my
stint as a summer instructor for 15-150, the introductory functional programming
class at CMU, I was able to work off of course material that had already been
taught for years. There was no need for me to design a whole curriculum from
scratch.</p>
<p>But, even though the pure information content of the course was predetermined,
an important lesson that we derive from the film <em>Megamind</em> is that there is one
aspect which separates an <a href="https://youtu.be/dy2zB8bLSpk?si=HIk3h5GBnntdS_DF">instructor from a super-instructor</a>:</p>
<img src="&#x2F;presentation.jpg" class="center blog-image" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/><!-- presentation -->
<p>With information comes the <em>presentation</em> of that information, and with
presentation comes stylistic choices. With those comes a whole other world of
issues and challenges, because information may be immutable, but how it is
conveyed to someone can make a world of difference in how it is retained,
remembered, and understood.</p>
<p>This blog post is about <strong><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">designing</span></strong> a course, in the sense of
artistic design. It's an exploration of how, over twelve weeks and months of
preparation, I attempted to create a comprehensive style that could not just
present material to students, but engage their attention fully, primarily
through the creation of visual content for students to refer back to in the form
of slides.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="why-does-design-matter"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#why-does-design-matter" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-does-design-matter">Why does design matter?</a></h1>
<p>Once thing which I took away from my undergraduate education is just <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">how hard it is to capture people&#x27;s attention</span>. This was witnessed
firsthand by myself, as I spent probably over 70% of my time in
college lectures asleep.<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="This was not primarily the fault of the
instructors, but instead of a poor sleep schedule on my part."></a></sup></p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  I spent probably over 70% of my time in college lectures asleep.
</div>
<p>Having taught students before as a TA, I know that <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">teaching students
who don&#x27;t want to be taught is impossible</span>. I also know from experience with
myself, that the only way that I can be engaged with content is when the content
is itself engaging<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="The astute reader notices that this is a
tautology."></a></sup>. <strong>Design matters</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm something of a visual learner, in that when I see a very well-done diagram,
I remember that diagram. I am more incentivized to look at graphics when they
are pretty -- I am more incentivized to look at <em>slides</em> when they are
pretty<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="One might liken this to the phenomena of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babylab.ucla.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;8&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;Slater-et-al-2000.pdf&quot;&gt;babies&amp;#39; preference for attractive faces&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Unfortunately, I transferred out of my psychology degree, so I lack
the credentials to justify this claim."></a></sup>. My goal was to create a set of
slide decks that would truly cause people to pay attention.</p>
<p>One interesting corollary of this is that, because I chose to present my slides
live during lectures, I needed slides that I could teach a lesson to. At the
same time, however, I knew that 150 did not have a textbook, and that students
needed referenceable material so that they could study adequately. There existed
lecture notes, but they were typeset and drab, and I wanted to do better.</p>
<p>So my goals for my lecture slides were threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>They needed to be structured in a way such that <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">I could teach a
lesson to them</span>, without students losing focus or tabbing out. This means
that I could not simply dump text on them--they needed to feel dynamic.</li>
<li>They needed to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">helpful to people who are studying the lecture
after the fact</span>, and be as referenceable and helpful as a textbook on the
subject. In essence, my slides need to serve <em>as</em> the textbook for the course.</li>
<li>They needed to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">thematically consistent</span>, in terms of having
predictable structure that would cause students to be able to build the right
conceptual understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly to how <em>leitmotifs</em> in music are recurring musical elements which highlight
a particular idea or character, I had a few consistent visual themes that I would
use in my slides. My belief is that <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">similar information should be
presented similarly, visually</span>, becuase it ultimately creates material that is
easier to follow along.</p>
<h1 id="design-themes"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#design-themes" aria-label="Anchor link for: design-themes">Design Themes</a></h1>
<h4 id="color-palette"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#color-palette" aria-label="Anchor link for: color-palette">Color Palette</a></h4>
<p>One such way this manifested was in the color schemes for each slide deck. Each
slide was characterized by a primary color palette and a secondary color palette.
The primary color is usually a fairly bold color that characterizes the borders
and backgrounds of the slides, and the secondary color is a sometimes contrasting,
also bright color which is used for highlighting purposes. I did not come up with
this idea, but I acquired it when I inherited Jacob Neumann's slides, a previous
150 instructor.</p>
<p>One such way I used this idea was in <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">terms</span>. This was my term (haha)
for vocabulary words, or instances of terms which I do not think that students would
have encountered before. Essentially, important words. These would be highlighted
in the secondary color, always, which would tell students that they should be paying
attention.</p>
<div class="image-gallery">

  
  
    
    
  
  <img src="https://brandonspark.github.io/colored1.png" class="left" style="
           width: 49%;
           float: left;
         " />



  
  
    
    
  
  <img src="https://brandonspark.github.io/colored2.png" class="right" style="
           width: 49%;
           float: right;
         " />

</div>
<p>These colors would also be used in each slide's syntax highlighting, as well as to
color certain blocks, which denote things like key facts, definitions, examples,
and mantras. Ultimately, these colors served as lightweight visual cues, meaning
"hey, pay attention".</p>
<h4 id="title-slides"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#title-slides" aria-label="Anchor link for: title-slides">Title Slides</a></h4>
<p>Presentation matters a lot, and it matters most at the beginning of a lecture.
How can you draw someone's attention in in the first minute, and make them excited
for the lecture that is to come? You need to have a great first title slide. First
impressions matter.</p>
<p>Traditional title slides done in Beamer (the LaTeX set-up I constructed my slides in)
typically all look quite similar, with a presentation name in some colored box, and
with authorship information scattered elsewhere.</p>
<img src="&#x2F;beamer_title.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 60%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>This is tried and true, but puts me to sleep. I wanted something which might stick
in their brains, which would announce the subject material in a dynamic way. I needed
something more personalized to the course.</p>
<p>With the help of my friend Boro, a designer at Semgrep, we came up with a rough prototype
of a template that could be filled in for each lecture:</p>
<img src="&#x2F;prototemplate.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>With a little polish and fine tuning, we arrived at our final template:</p>
<img src="&#x2F;template.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>There were a few constraints I had to contend with to get here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to have a lambda on it somewhere, hopefully obvious and prominent<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="This probably goes without saying."></a></sup>.</li>
<li>I wanted to have a background image, which would hopefully add some contrasting
detail to the simplicity of the lambda. The obvious solution was to place the lambda at
the right, and have it frame the background image, which would take up the rest
of the space.</li>
<li>An artistic choice was to have it be multiple lambdas, all folding in to each
other, in order to evoke a sense of recursion, or neverendingness. These lambdas
would be colored differently, to give a more nuanced color palette to the slide
deck.</li>
<li>We resolved the awkward "tail" at the top of the lambda by stretching it
across the top of the border with a horizontal line. This also gave a
convenient place to announce the title of the course.</li>
<li>This left only on top of the background image, for the lecture title and other
metadata to go. This can be problematic, though, as white text is not easily
visible on all kinds of backgrounds. This was resolved with Boro's suggestion to
place a gradient background above the background image, which fades to black as
you get farther down. It's hard to notice if you aren't looking for it, but
makes the text much easier to see.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the background image, I usually chose something I found visually interesting
which would moderately relate back to the content of the lecture. For instance, for
the asymptotic analysis lecture, I chose a mountain, which I thought was an
appropriate representation of something which grows seemingly neverendingly.
For the lecture on parallelism and sorting, I chose a stylized representation of
a sorting algorithm that I found on Google, which worked out quite well.</p>
<div class="image-gallery">

  
  
    
    
  
  <img src="https://brandonspark.github.io/lect6.png" class="left" style="
           width: 49%;
           float: left;
         " />



  
  
    
    
  
  <img src="https://brandonspark.github.io/lect7.png" class="right" style="
           width: 49%;
           float: right;
         " />

</div>
<p>For later lectures, this stopped working out as much. For things like
<a href="https://brandonspark.github.io/functors/">functors</a>,
<a href="https://brandonspark.github.io/hofs/">higher-order functions</a>, and
<a href="https://brandonspark.github.io/seq/">sequences</a>, it's actually
incredibly hard to find a good-looking picture which somehow relates back to
that topic. At this point, I was having trouble finding good premade pictures
online, so like any other engineer in 2023, I decided to fall back to AI tools.</p>
<p>The premier online prompt-to-image generation tool at the time was Midjourney,
which I made copious use of during the course. It turns out that usually it's
fairly easy to come up with some abstract idea of what I want the slide image to
represent, but hard to find someone who has already specially created such an
image. Midjourney bridges that gap nicely, as for most such things I can think
of, I can just do a bit of prompt engineering to get it to display what I want.</p>
<img src="&#x2F;midjourney.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 70%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>For instance, the CPS background image above is actually generated by Midjourney,
and represents a classic way of teaching CPS that I have been using for years,
by imagining the growing lambda expression of the continuation as a "donut", or
layered circle. I was very happy with this result.</p>
<h4 id="theses"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#theses" aria-label="Anchor link for: theses">Theses</a></h4>
<p>To highlight the lessons being taught in the course, before the course ever
began I came up with three theses that I wanted students to be able to
concretely take away from the course. They were <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Recursive Problems,
 Recursive Solutions</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Programmatic Thinking is Mathematical
 Thinking</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Types Guide Structure</span><sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="Described
 in more detail in the main blog post &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;teaching&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;."></a></sup>.</p>
<p>I knew that I would often forget to bring up the Three Theses at later points
in the course, but I didn't want it to feel like a vapid, first-day detail
that would never show up again. I truly do believe that the three theses are
fundamental to the course, and in consolidating meaningful takeaways from it,
so there <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">needed to be a way to integrate it into each lesson</span>.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted a visual cue to indicate when a thesis applied, but how would
this be achieved? I could denote it in an inline colored block, as I did with
other significant details, but this felt like a different kind of importance. It
wasn't a definition, key fact, or vocabulary term, it was more of a motif or
reoccurring idea. Writing it in the main canvas of the page felt like it would
take away too much from the content of the lesson. I needed somewhere with
unused space.</p>
<p>I ended up being able to find a solution, in placing the badge of the thesis
in the title bar, to the left of the lambda that accompanied every slide:</p>
<img src="&#x2F;tgs.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>This worked out fairly well, with the exception of slides which had exceptionally

<p>Stylized text is one thing, but the aspect of visual presentations I think is most
important is in the diagrams.</p>
<p>You can make words as pretty as you'd like, but that doesn't change the fact that
they are words. This can help with incentivizing someone to read them, which is
better than them not being read at all, but you are limited to the inherent ability
of words to transmit information, which is sometimes lacking.</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">A picture is worth a thousand words</span>, so when it came to my lessons, I made sure that
if I could present something visually to a student, I would have an interesting, stylized
diagram for them. I find that I am something of a visual learner, and even if I don't
recall the precise details, the "imprint" of a well-done diagram can stay with me for
years.</p>
<p>One diagram I got a lot of use out of involved a hierarchical lattice:</p>

<p>I believe that, if you have this pictorial idea of knowing that you can think
about things like induction, subtyping, and evaluation in this way, it only
takes a little bit more thinking to rederive the whole thing from scratch. I
personally benefit a lot from having this intuition.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study: Lecture 17 - Sequences</strong></p>
<p>For this lecture, I knew that having a nice-looking representation of cost
graphs would go a long way to making them palatable. The typical 150 notes
on cost graphs have them as ASCII graphs with typeset characters, which is
fine for comprehension, but not something that particularly engaged me when
I was a student.</p>
<p>Two ways that this manifests are in <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">shapes</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">colors</span>. These are the dimensions that I have an advantage in,
versus the typeset example. I knew I wanted to take advantage of these.</p>
<p>For the fundamentals of cost graphs, I reused the core idea of having sequential
and parallel composition of graphs be denoted by singular or branching edges.
The joins and nodes were mostly where I had some freedom.</p>
<img src="&#x2F;lect17_fundamentals.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>When joined together into a real cost graph, I wanted a distinction between the
fundamental units of the graphs themselves, and a kind of "syntactic sugar" for
a terse representation of a larger sub-graph. This gave way to the distinction
between "computation nodes" and "cost nodes", in purple and green respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study: Lecture 16 - Red-Black Trees</strong></p>
<p>Red-black trees are the final boss in terms of graphics. The importance of
colors is literally in the name of the data structure, so I needed to step up
my tree game, which historically took the form of just uncolored circles on the
normal slide background.</p>
<p>One thing which stood out to me about this problem was how to represent a sense of
<em>dynamicness</em>, in the sense that red-black trees are often characterized by the
way that their shape changes over time. How do I reflect that dynamic behavior over
time in a static, 2D image, without the reader getting confused and forgetting where
we came from?</p>
<p>To facilitate this, I made use of highlighted nodes, which consisted of a yellow
border around particular nodes that I wanted to point out, for instance when
inserting a node<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="While you may note that, during a live lecture, I
can point out there details myself, in order to ensure that post-lecture
students reading the slides can get the same experience, the same kind of
information has to be conveyed statically."></a></sup>. When the color of a node was
unclear, I also used a kind of TBD node, which had a not-quite-red patterned
background, to signal that its color had yet to be determined.</p>
<img src="&#x2F;lect16_highlight.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>When it came to red-black tree invariants, I also wanted to be able to quickly
visually indicate whether a given tree satisfied the invariants or not, without
needing to take up paragraph space by just writing it out with words. This led me
to a common design I used, which was to place the tree into a red or green slightly
beveled box, which indicated the invariants which were satisfied (or not).</p>

         " />

</div>
<p>This led me to traces where I was satisfied with how you could tell the "diff" from
the previous image, by seeing the added highlighted parts. The highlighted nodes also
came in useful to identify the "triads" of nodes which were to be rebalanced.</p>

<p>Overall, the graphics and attention to small details in my course took up the
majority of my time when creating content. While not a stipulation imposed upon
anyone other than myself, I found that creating visually appealing content, like
tail recursion, was its own kind of reward<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1270&#x2F;&quot;&gt;xkcd reference haha&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;"></a></sup>.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the course, I wanted to make one last synthesis of the
designs that I had constructed over the course of the semester, as a keepsake to
put in my room. With some help from my friend Gabriel, we came up a poster for
my iteration of the class:</p>
<img src="&#x2F;150poster.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>I was very happy with this, and consider it the capstone of the effort I put into
this semester, in terms of aesthetics.</p>
<p>It's not the case that my sense of aesthetics was the only beneficiary of this work,
though. During the course, I received much feedback that the attention to detail in the
slides and its visually appealing nature was greatly appreciated by students, and that
it helped them to pay attention and be interested in the material.</p>
<img src="&#x2F;pretty_slides_data.png" class="center blog-image" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/>
<p>That's all you can really ask for, at the end of the day.</p>
