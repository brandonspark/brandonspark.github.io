In the obvious ways, they are reminiscent. Both are metal rectangular cages that people
enter and exit. The fundamental difference between them seems to be one of function--one
is for movement, and one is for communication. This is where most people would find the
analogy to be suspect.

But in certain ways, they emulate each other. A person walking into an elevator expects
to walk out with everything around them having changed. Some phone booths, people can
walk into and walk out of with nothing really being significantly different.

But on some days, you walk into a phone booth and emerge a completely different person.
Some days, you exit with the entire universe having changed, even if physically in the
same location.

<p>I found myself in a cramped, unventilated phone booth when my dreams came true.</p>
<p>The bare WeWork call booth was dimly lit by my laptop, which displayed a
Zoom waiting room. My leg bounced incessantly, mimicking the race of my heart.
My mother had told me to stop doing that.</p>
<p>I was moments away from a meeting with a professor from Carnegie Mellon's School
of Computer Science, to discuss my potential appointment as the summer instructor
for 15-150, Principles of Functional Programming. At only 23 years old, I had
only had a few job interviews in my life, and I felt woefully unprepared.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Should I have dressed formally, even in the laid-back tech hub of San Francisco,
where the lack of a Patagonia jacket and converse would have made me stick out
like a sore thumb? Should I have better prepared my shpiel on how much I wanted
this opportunity?</p>
<p>I didn't have the right words. In that instant, I didn't know how I could
possibly convey that I didn't just want it, I <em>needed</em> this job opportunity.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell anyone that this moment could either fulfill my dream or kill it outright.</p>

teaching 15-150 as the instructor of record in the summer 2023 semester.</p>
<p>This was a long trial of months of preparation, late nights, emails, and
back-breaking work that threatened to overwhelm me at times. In the wake of such
a semester, I thought it would make a fitting first blog post, to record and
review what happened and what I learned from this summer.</p>
<p>This is a story in multiple parts, but it starts with <em>why</em> it was so important
that I obtain the job to teach functional programming. Why did it matter so much
to me?</p>
<!-- <p style="color: gray; font-style: italic;">
This blog post is about three things--my personal journey and story in becoming a teacher,
my road to wanting to teach functional programming, and my reflections on the aftermath
of teaching functional programming at CMU. If you are more interested in the technical

<p>I don't have much of a connection to my extended family.</p>
<p>This is owed to, in part, by being the child of first-generation immigrants from
China, and having an extended family that will never be able to read this
article. Stories of my grandparents or cousins in China may as well have been
written in a storybook, about characters of fiction. They are about equally as
likely to have an impact on my life.</p>
<p>I have only one instance where I can remember putting stock in my connections to
my more distant relatives. In high school, during a project to interview an
elder relative, I discovered that my grandfather, similar to my father, had been
a university professor.</p>
<p>I don't know that I put much stock in fate, but this felt like something
similar. In my early years where I didn't know who I was, it seemed like a sign,
like the universe had a role for me to fill after all. I could continue the legacy.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">

<p>I was convinced, throughout much of college, that I wanted to be a professor. I
wore clothes that I deemed to be "academic"<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="If you have pictures
of me from 2019, no you don&#x27;t."></a></sup>, buried my head in my studies, and fretted
over silly things like my GPA or applications that I would end up never writing.
I applied to be a teaching assistant and found teaching to be one of my greatest
joys, returning to teach the course 15-150 six times over my undergraduate
career.</p>
<p>Life seemed simple and clear-cut. Birds chirped, rain fell, and I was going to be
a professor.</p>
<div style="justify-content: center; align-items: center; display: flex; font-size: 16pt;">

</div>
<p>But, life, as it so often does, had other plans for me.</p>
<p>In my senior year, burned out by remote learning during COVID, and years of
intense studying, I realized that I didn't want to pursue an academic career. I
became disillusioned with research and the projects that seemed interesting on
paper, but failed to motivate me to actually do the work. I disliked the
research papers that seemed written by an elite club of people specifically to
keep me out.</p>
<p>I called it quits, simply put, and took a job in the industry as a software
engineer. By turning my back on a Ph.D, I said goodbye to my hopes of one day
attaining an instructing position at the university level. I thought that was
the end of it. A pivot in the startup of my life.</p>

<p>The universe kindly decided to prove me wrong.</p>
<p>It was in early 2023 that I discovered that there was a shortage for a summer
instructor for 15-150, my course which I loved so much, and I reached out to Tom
Cortina, the SCS undergraduate coordinator, to see if there was any opportunity.
It would be my last hope at achieving the dream I had fostered for so many
years.</p>
<p>I obtained an interview with a professor, and watched the days tick down to it
with bated breath. I told no one. I was afraid that my dream was so fragile, it
would shatter if I spoke about it. I was afraid that it would be taken from me
if I dared to hope it was possible.</p>

<p>In the call booth of the WeWork, I rubbed my cold hands together at the
conclusion of the meeting. It's funny how so much thought can go into a moment
that is over in a flash. I can scarcely remember the words that were said. I
can't even remember the professor's face.</p>
<p>All that matters is that, a short twenty minutes after it started, I had verbal
confirmation that I would be offered the opportunity to return to Carnegie
Mellon, my alma mater, but as staff instead of student. I would be offered the
opportunity to return to the fires of the forge that had shaped me, but to stoke
it for others instead.</p>
<p>Looking back, the lack of glamour of the scene is funny. There should have been
confetti, a shower of lights, or someone waiting to shake my hand in
congratulations. It was as anticlimactic as the graduation I never walked at, a
year earlier.</p>
<p>But there was no confetti, and no shower of lights, just the quiet fan of my
computer as I processed what had just happened to me. The start of my story, it
seems, was not beholden to the laws of the innumerate stories that I had read
before.</p>
<p>It is there, in the phone booth set to the side of our small WeWork, in the
stolen moments between meetings at my 9-5 job, that I was offered everything
that I had ever wanted.</p>
<h1 id="part-2-why-functional-programming"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#part-2-why-functional-programming" aria-label="Anchor link for: part-2-why-functional-programming">Part 2: Why functional programming?</a></h1>
<p>Carnegie Mellon's undergraduate computer science curriculum is known for its
rigor, comprehensiveness, and in certain ways, its unorthodox approach.</p>
<p>This manifests in several key ways, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis on theory over engineering and hardware<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="I didn&#x27;t know what a transistor was until last year."></a></sup></li>
<li>Focus on <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/">parallel time complexity and parallel algorithms</a></li>
<li>Focus on <a href="https://brandonspark.github.io/blog/teaching/">functional programming</a><sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="If you click this, you might notice that it links back to the same article you are reading.

</ul>
<p>The first two points are fit for exploration by a different blog post, but the
third will be our focus.</p>
<p>Functional programming is typically taken as the second or third course
(depending on the student's previous computer science background) of all
computer science majors at Carnegie Mellon. This contrasts to other universities, where the topic
would either be an elective, or possibly not even offered.</p>

<p>I first encountered the subject as a freshman cognitive science major in 2019. I
knew I was in for something special when I didn't need my computer for the entire
first lecture.</p>
<p>The professor started talking about how we were going to learn about "ML", and I
remember looking around, wondering if I had joined the wrong classroom. What was
this language, "Standard ML", that were learning, and why had I never heard of
it?</p>
<p>I took out my computer. Surely we were going to use them. Surely, in a programming
class, we were going to be doing some computer programming.</p>
<p>The professor, instead of pulling up a terminal or text editor, pulled out a
sheet of paper and a desk camera. He told me he was going to teach us types, and
that they were going to be the most essential part of my computer science
education.</p>
<div style="justify-content: center; align-items: center; display: flex; font-size: 16pt;">

</div>
<p>Critics of functional programming sometimes speak of its perceived esoteric
nature, the detriments of learning a language that one would never actually
apply in the "real world". They speak of the unnaturality of seeing the keyword
<code>let</code>, and how function names should never be separated by a space from their
arguments<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="These are, of course, all surface-level concerns. The
tendency of programmers to place undue emphasis on the syntax of programming
languages is one that I find disturbing."></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The perspective taken by CMU is that courses do not teach languages. <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Courses
teach concepts, and the languages come after.</span></p>
<p>Some programming courses are about the <em>syntax</em>. They are about how to write the
<em>words</em> of a program, and hopefully with a little bit of luck and elbow grease
along the way, a correct program will be produced. The meaning of what is being
written, and the concepts that those words map to, are of secondary concern. In
the post-LLM world, this is an approach that all of us are familiar with the
drawbacks of.</p>
<p>15-150 was one of the first courses I took where it was apparent to me that <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">programming
is about the semantics</span>. It is far more important what goes in your head, what high-level
constructs you create when decomposing a system and devising a solution, than any characters
or concrete details that you render into text.</p>
<p>I embraced functional programming because, for the first time, I felt like
I was given a system which encouraged me to articulate my thoughts and <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">solve
first, program second</span>. Silly mistakes that would normally be fatal were
prevented by strict type-checking, nudging me to revisit my assumptions. A rich
type system offered me the tools to architect my solutions at the high level,
then work downwards.</p>
<p>In the previous semester, I had participated in a hackathon, where my sole
contribution was struggling to write a basic recursive graph search in Python.
In it, I spent at least an hour debugging my function, which kept returning
<code>None</code> at me no matter what I tried, even though I didn't even think that it
should be possible. I thought that recursion was to blame for my inability.</p>
<p>After 150, I realized that what I had mistaken for an inability to do recursion
was simply a lack of elementary <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">reasoning about my program&#x27;s inputs
and outputs</span>. This may seem seem unrelated to functional programming, but
ultimately it's the perfect skill that can be trained by the paradigm, because
it's precisely what functional programming is about--<span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">safety</span> and
<span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">correctness</span>.</p>
<div style="justify-content: center; align-items: center; display: flex; font-size: 16pt;">

</div>
<p>I have four main reasons why I think that people are often opposed to learning
functional programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>They didn't learn it in school, and feel some perceived esotericity or
exclusivity--functional programming is a club, and they weren't invited.</li>
<li>They believe that it is too complex, or they that they lack some innate aptitude to do functional programming,
like it is a talent gifted to few that are fortunate.</li>
<li>They believe it has marginal benefit.</li>
<li><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/turbo-8-is-dropping-typescript-70165c01">They are David Heinemeier Hansson.</a><sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="For the record, this is not an endorsement."></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Some have approached me with the second and third points.</p>
<p>Over my years of TAing the course, I found these statements hard to justify. I
couldn't believe people's claims that functional programming was simply too
difficult, too advanced, when I had seen 18 and 19 year olds master it with flying
colors for years.</p>

</div>
<p>I couldn't believe that it was some unimportant, optional side detail in a
computer science education, when I had seen how transformative of an effect it
had on students' perspectives and abilities.</p>
<p>Although I was suspicious of these claims, as a TA I was operating in
a role that was an accessory to the learning process. I was a helper, and
although I had my opinions, I did not feel like I had the authority to challenge
them on a broader level.</p>
<p>I needed to be an instructor for 15-150 because I had to challenge these statements
myself. I had to see for myself that they were false.</p>

<h2 id="themes"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#themes" aria-label="Anchor link for: themes">Themes</a></h2>
<p>One of the first things on my mind was how to make my iteration of the course
memorable.</p>
<p>I find that I often forget the details of a course, once it has ended. If it's
not something that I will exercise regularly once the course concludes, it's
usually something that will be wiped from my mind within the next year,
unfortunately.<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="

<p>However, what do I remember from those courses? From courses whose content have
all but escaped me, I still remember some of the big ideas. I remember some of
the flavors of problems that I had to solve for my probability course, even if I
can't do any of the math anymore. I remember the vague impression of an
undecidability reduction proof. And most of all, I remember the <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">themes</span>.</p>
<p>It's like when you try to recall a story, and you can't remember the precise
plot details, but you can remember the morals that you were supposed to take
away. I'm a storyteller by nature, and I couldn't help but think of my course in
the same way. I was going to tell a story over twelve weeks, and I needed that
story to be cohesive. I needed that story to be <em>engrossing</em>.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  I was going to tell a story over twelve weeks, and I needed that story to be cohesive.
</div>
<p>So, it was with this understanding that I spent the first two weeks of planning
coming up with learning objectives, concrete statements of fact that I wanted
students to take away from the course. Then, I put them all together and started
drawing lines between them, in a way that is not dissimilar to completing a
picture by connect-the-dots. I wanted to find the overarching ideas that
permeated all of them.</p>
<p>I came up with the following three themes<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="An in-depth explanation of these themes is
fit for another post. I&#x27;ll omit it here for brevity."></a></sup>:</p>

</ul>
<p>The important idea here is that these ideas are <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">permanent</span>. Many
courses in my life I have taken and immediately discarded, used for a grade and
then immediately forgotten about. Sometimes, that's just how it is. But my role as
an instructor was to show students that 15-150 was not one of those courses --
that these ideas are fundamental, that they will stay with you for the rest of
your life.</p>
<!--
#### Recursive Problems, Recursive Solutions

<span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Recursive Problems, Recursive Solutions</span> is about overcoming the
demon of recursion that seems to sit on people's shoulders. I've witnessed
countless people who consider recursion a bogeyman, a tool which they do not
understand and are afraid to consort with. This couldn't be farther from the
truth! I wanted to get across the usefulness and *practicality* of recursion,
without leaving the impression that we were shoehorning it into every problem we
could find.

Moreover, I have found that people rarely have an issue with *recursion*. Most
of the time, students have trouble with recursion because they have trouble with
**clearly specifying their functions' behavior**, in terms of its inputs and
outputs. While admitting a weakness with "recursion" seems to be socially
acceptable statement, I believe that it is dangerous, because it belies a weakness
with a far more fundamental skill.

As such, I came up with a more tempered slogan, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Recursive
Problems, Recursive Solutions</span>. This slogan is about the fact that, not only
do we employ recursive solutions, but they emerge **naturally** out of recursive
problems. Recursion is not something ad-hoc or unprecedented, it is the most
natural solution to some of the most natural problems that there are. The same
structure that makes up a list or a tree is the structure by which we solve
computational problems on them.

#### Programmatic Thinking is Mathematical Thinking

Math shows up a fair amount in 150. We go from the subjects of work and span
(sequential and parallel time complexity), solved via mathematical recurrences,
to inductively proving the correctness of our code by structural induction. More
fundamentally than that, the notion of equivalence between different parts of
code is a very deep idea that immutability grants, and it shows up all the
time when writing real functional code.

I wanted a theme which could serve as the natural evolution of the idea that
induction and recursion are the same. It's not *just* an induction thing, it's a
*math* thing -- programming and math can be related quite a bit at the end of
the day<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="If you want to sound really pretentious to ordinary software
engineers, link them to a Wikipedia page on category theory, like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Initial_algebra&quot;&gt;this one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
tell them to &quot;read the literature&quot;."></a></sup>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Programmatic Thinking is Mathematical Thinking</span> is not
so much about the fact that programming is literally the same as math. It's
about the fact that mathematical tools can be used by programmers to achieve
better results.

It shows up when reasoning about the cost of code. It shows up when reasoning
about when code is correct. It shows up when architecting code to be simpler and
easy-to-understand--that is the point. Before computer scientists were
computer scientists, they were mathematicians.

#### Types Guide Structure

At this point, I had two themes that were more or less about the kind of problem
solving employed in 150. We use recursive ideas and mathematical tools to help
us reason about our code, but what about the specific content of the course?
What kind of theme, in a more direct and content-related sense, could summarize
the class?

I find that this comes all down to <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">types</span>. In 150, it is often
said that the typechecker is the students' worst enemy, for the first two weeks.
By the end of the course, the typechecker is the students' best friend. Learning to
play around a programming language with a disciplined type system, and indeed,
structure their very thinking around this idea of types and the rich data
that they describe, allows us a wide array of possibilities when it comes to
problem-solving.

<div class="pull-quote">
  In 150, it is often said that the typechecker is the students&#x27;
worst enemy ... By the end of the course, the typechecker
is the students&#x27; best friend.
</div>


A sub-idea of this theme is that small things give way to big changes. Via just a
simple idea of function types, we get higher-order functions, currying, and this
idea of parameterizing code over other code. With variables that range over
types, we get parametric polymorphism and all the convenience that it offers.
With algebraic data types, we get the freedom to describe data extremely
precisely, and fit our types to describe our problems. None of these are themselves
big, flashy ideas necessarily, but they mean the world when it comes to writing
real, maintainable code.

<p>It turns out that, in terms of the stylistic design that went into 150 for this

<p>I have never been one for bureaucracy. One reason why I enjoy working at a
startup is being able to know everyone's name and not feeling confined to a box.
Whenever I feel like process or red tape is taking precedence over treating
people as humans, it frustrates me.</p>
<p>With this perspective, I decided that I would offer my students as lenient of an
experience as I could. The end goal of a college course, above all else, is that
students learn -- I tried to focus on this beyond anything
else, and do whatever it took to get my students there, even if it didn't
exactly align with traditional course policy.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  The end goal of a college course, above all else, is that students learn.
</div>
<p>So this semester, <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">I granted every single extension that anyone ever asked me
for</span>. My reasoning was that, since most of the learning in 150 happens from doing
the homework assignments, if a student doesn't receive an extension and doesn't
finish the rest of it, they aren't learning.</p>
<p>The practical effect is that I had a lot of people ask me for extensions. At
times it would frustrate me that students were continuously asking for what felt
like a deluge of extensions. Was I doing wrong, by granting so many of them?
Were students exploiting my leniency for some nefarious ends?</p>
<p>The thing is, I think that this kind of thinking can benefit from a derivative
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's
Razor</a>.<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="It seems to me that there are so many damn razors on
the internet that they should go and start a barbershop quartet."></a></sup> Never
attribute to malice that which can be attributed to... well, anything else. My
frustration was in the thought that students were somehow deliberately asking
for too many extensions, or were taking advantage of my leniency, but the point
is that <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">students aren&#x27;t the enemy</span>. It's not a black-and-white,
adversarial kind of thing. This kind of reasoning just came out of exhaustion
and self-doubt. It solves precisely zero problems.</p>
<p>So I don't regret giving out all of those extensions, because at the end of the
day, I don't believe you can ever really doubt a student's reason for asking for
an extension. If a student needs help, they will ask, and it's not on you to
validate whether it is legitimate. The point is just to set up students for
success, not to constrain the conditions under which they can.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  If a student needs help, they will ask, and it&#x27;s not on you to
validate whether it is legitimate.
</div>
<p>There's a "but" to this section, however. Due to all the extensions I gave,
keeping on top of all of them was a real struggle for me.
Sometimes, I would grant an extension, and have to track down their submission
for the assignment, placing more of the onus on myself than the student whose
work it was. Although I don't regret being lenient, it was extremely draining on
me. Fifty students was already the maximal amount I could deal with, while
attending to each personally. Scaling up this kind of treatment would be untenable.</p>
<p>So for professors who teach hundreds of students at a time, as a student I might
have not understood why they adhered to strictly to policy, or were seemingly
hard on me for no reason, but it takes a more nuanced perspective to realize
that, <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">really truly, instructors have a hard job</span>. It's still
possible to care for every student. But it's not possible to grant hundreds of
students the same level of attention that I was able to.</p>

<h4 id="failure-is-expected"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#failure-is-expected" aria-label="Anchor link for: failure-is-expected">Failure is expected.</a></h4>
<p>Or, more accurate, <em>some</em> failure is expected. This isn't a claim that it's OK
or desirable that there should always be some students who fail a class--I do
believe that the objective of a class should be that every student passes.</p>
<p>This is more of a commentary on my experience as a first-time test-writer. While
150 TAs are offered an unparalleled level of power to control the assignments of
the course, it is the custom that professors are fully in charge of writing the
examinations. This being my first time as an instructor, this was also my first
experience with writing an examination.</p>
<p>Several times during the semester, I would write a problem which I thought to be
eminently reasonable, only for students to not perform as well as I would have
hoped. I confess that this caused me quite a deal of depression. Was I failing
as an instructor, for failing to prepare students for what I judged to be a
relatively simple problem?</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  Was I failing as an instructor, for failing to prepare students for what I judged to be a relatively simple problem?
</div>
<p>I believe that there are a few things which are responsible for this. For one,
although I was closer than most instructors, it is very difficult to remember
what it is like to learn a topic for the very first time. Even problems which I
judged to be "no big deal" were often still written by myself to be
<em>interesting</em>, meaning some non-trivial, non-synthetic problem.</p>
<p>In normal test-taking constraints of only an hour or two, the effort required to
problem-solve is highly variable. It is ultimately a stressful
environment<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="Doubly stressful, for me included, after one
particular hilarious incident where a fire drill occurred during an examination.
I had to write another one."></a></sup> which I hadn't helped with my focus on writing
somewhat more difficult problems.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is not realistic to expect that every student <em>excels</em>. There
will always be a gradient, and while it is the instructor's job to ensure that
every student gets the base level of understanding from a course, not every
student can go above and beyond. Part of my frustration, I realized, was in
the fact that I desperately wanted every student to excel.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  Part of my frustration... was in the fact that I desparately wanted every student to excel.
</div>
<p>This is a lesson that I had to learn as the semester went on, where I began to
realize that it wasn't realistic to place my standards so high, for my students
or for myself. It's no use crying over spilled points.</p>
<p>Students will succeed and students will fail. All that you can do is try your best to
help the student do better the next time.</p>
<h4 id="the-proof-is-in-the-passion"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-proof-is-in-the-passion" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-proof-is-in-the-passion">The proof is in the passion.</a></h4>
<p>I'm a very intense person by nature. The only way that I know how to live my
life is to throw myself wholeheartedly into all that which I do, and to believe
in it so strongly that I cannot imagine anything else.</p>
<p>From the first day of planning, I always intended to make this apparent to my
students. The majority of my time as an undergraduate in college lectures, I
spent asleep, due to a combination of irresponsible habits and a troublesome
lack of belief in the material. There were professors who certainly did a good
job at conveying this belief, but some classes I just couldn't bring myself to
care enough.</p>
<p>As I wrote in a meme I made for the course years ago as a TA,
<a href="https://youtu.be/tonfECxK3BU">150 is not a spectator sport</a>. I could not afford
to have my students have that same lack of faith, at least not without trying my
best to convince them that not only was what they were learning important, it
was <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">essential</span>. I truly do believe that with every bone in my body.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is that I believe that there is an equal and opposite
reaction. Something pushed, pushes back. When you speak, somebody listens. When
you put effort and energy into the material, I believe students are more likely
to do the same in return.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  When you put effort and energy into the material, I believe students are more likely to do the same in return.
</div>
<p>So, every lecture I would arrive with a lesson plan and the energy and
enthusiasm to see it through. I focused (sometimes at length) on the motivation
and story behind every piece of content, so that not only would students learn
the material, but hopefully be able to rederive why it was important.</p>
<p>I think that teaching is multifacted, by intrinsic loss of information. A lecture
is the result of hours of compressed time, hours poring over examples and learning
materials, and distilled into words meant to fill an hour-and-a-half interval. The
compression is lossy in two respects--<span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">you cannot expect a student to recover the
context of the original material</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">you cannot expect a student to remember every
rapid-fire word that is delivered</span><sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="I have this issue, in particular, because I am a yapper."></a></sup>.</p>
<p>As a result, I believe that an instructor's job is not to 100% convey all of the
information to the student in the limited time of the lecture. It is also to
give the student the drive and motivation to seek out the answers to the parts
that they did not understand. It is to give the students the power to teach
themselves.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  An instructor&#x27;s job... is to give the students the power to teach themselves.

<p>Throughout the course, I have collected feedback in the form of post-lecture
surveys and the official course evaluations that students leave at the
conclusion of the class. Some of the post-lecture data is pictured below:<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="

<p>Consistently, students have left me messages and emails
expressing appreciation for the effort and passion they can see in the course,
as well as for the desire for learning the material that it has inspired in them.</p>
<p>These messages are among my most treasured possessions. I have saved each one.</p>

<p>The focus of Part 2 of this post was on why it was so important to me to not
only teach, but to teach functional programming in particular. How did it
match up to what I believed?</p>
<p>Over the course's tenure, I faced the stress of working my job as an instructor
concurrently with my job as a software engineer, the looming deadlines of
upcoming lectures that I had not yet written, and probably the least sleep that
I have ever gotten in my life, including my years as an undergraduate<sup><a id="footnote-ID-TODO" href="#footnote-ID-TODO" class="footnote-ref" content="This is an unfortunately high bar."></a></sup>. Despite
that, once the course got started, never once did I feel stress over the
<em>material</em> that I was teaching to my students. Never once did I feel doubt for
whether what I was teaching was <em>right</em>.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  Never once did I feel doubt for whether what I was teaching was right.

<p>The quest of teaching is one which is highly variable, for many reasons. There is
intrinsic variance among instructors and subject matters, but most importantly,
it is <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">heavily dependent on the students that are being taught</span>. I had the fortunate
experience to be teaching students who were not only open-minded and receptive, but
willing to grace me with their stories of how the course had affected them.</p>
<p>A classroom can feel like a rather impersonal affair, with a group of people judging
your words at a distance. Throughout the progression of a course, you eventually start
recognizing the faces, remembering the names of those you see, but it is still a one-sided
conversation. There is no built-in feedback mechanism from your students.</p>
<p>I frequently hosted post-lecture office hours precisely for the purpose of not only
helping students, but so I could hear their perspectives on their education, their lives,
and so I could offer them help in whatever ways I could. Some of the most valuable memories
I have occurred in those office hour sessions.</p>
<p>I recall regulars who would drop by my lectures just to chat, students who would
come for one-on-one assistance that they felt self-conscious about receiving
otherwise, and a student who told me that they called their mother about the
class, telling her how excited they were about what they were learning.</p>
<p>I recall a student who had taken the course before, who didn't feel like they
had <em>gotten it</em> until now, a student who told me that what they learned in 150
changed their perspective on computer science totally, and a student who told me
that 150 made them want to start doing computer science.</p>
<p>I recall a thoughtful email from a student at the conclusion of the course,
confessing they had never done so before, but wanted to tell me how much they
felt 150 had made an impact on their academic career.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
  I remember a student who told me that they called their

</div>
<p>All these stories are not to boast, but to simply say that from day 1, I <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">have
never had the impression that the course material was something which had little
impact on a student&#x27;s success or way of thinking</span>. Based on my students'
performance on exams and assignments, I have never had the impression that it
was simply an inherently complex topic that could only be taught to few. I have
never had the impression that there was only an inconsequential benefit.</p>

<p>I find that, when giving opinions on functional programming, people love to cite
the path that is well-traveled as justification for its superiority.</p>
<p>I teach and feel passion for a niche topic. I may not succeed at convincing
others of that through an online presence (indeed, that is not the purpose of
this article), but I am only here to report that, in all my experiences as an
instructor, it has only reaffirmed its importance, to me.</p>

<p>My conviction in the power and importance of that which I teach is not made out
of my own beliefs or desires, but shaped from the stories of the students who
have expressed so much gratitude at having learned the material. At the end of

<p>I confess an emptiness in my life now.</p>
<p>San Francisco is in many ways a more dynamic city than Pittsburgh, but somehow
it feels empty and static. Walking through the streets, my footsteps somehow are
louder, the thuds conveying a weight that is not based in mass. Although the Bay
breeze blows incessantly, it feels as though the wind has stilled somehow too.</p>
<p>It feels strange to return to a routine, to sleep a recommended amount of hours,
and to walk in to my 9-5 job and not feel the existential dread of an upcoming
lecture that I haven't yet written. It feels wrong to use my mental energy on
tasks that I can make predictable progress on every day, as opposed to sitting
in front of my laptop for hours and hours without writing a word, like trying to
squeeze blood from the stone that is my brain.</p>
<p>I find that the biggest difference is in the first ten minutes of the day. When
I wake up in my bed now, getting out is always optional. There's always another
five minutes asleep, another ten, up until the point where perhaps I have missed
the train or need to take my first meeting of the day.</p>
<p>Waking up in Pittsburgh was not a decision, it was a fact. Every day when I woke
up, I had what can only be described as <em>relentless purpose</em>. No matter how
little sleep, no matter what day of the week, I would wake up and be out of bed
within thirty seconds, immediately heading out in beautiful sunny weather to my
cool air-conditioned office where I would spend the majority of my day.</p>

<p>Some might describe such an experience as hellish, but that summer, I found it
exhilarating. There was no "why" to life, it simply was. I continued on not just
because I wanted to, but because I <em>had</em> to. No matter how much I was behind, I
would find a way to catch up. I would continue to produce content that I loved,
lectures that I exulted in, lessons that had real value to my students, because
it was just the way that things were. I couldn't have asked for a more
meaningful existence. I had found a <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">glorious purpose</span>.</p>
<p>My default state in the summer was to pour my hours into my tasks, and allocate
whatever remained to whatever other comforts I desired. Now, I stare into an
excess of time, served to me on a platter in pursuit of the ideal known as

thing that someone most in need of something is sometimes the least equipped to

is one that I am still figuring out as I go. Regardless, I don't think it is an
interpretation like "don't work yourself too hard" or "try not to burn out", as
good and true as those sentiments are.</p>
<p>I think it's that, for all of us, <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">glorious purpose exists in some
form or another</span>, waiting out there to be captured. "Glorious", not in an
objective, flashy sense, but in a personal, subjective one. It's not exactly the
purpose that I imagined when I was a child (although close), but for all that I'd
given up on it, life took me to one anyways.</p>
<p>But unlike a functional program, purpose is not immutable. The fact that I found
a new purpose and left it behind does not mean that I must chase it in my mind
and memories. Although I look fondly on the memories that I now have, and the
content that I have produced, it is with the knowledge that there is still so much
for me to learn and do.</p>
<p>Writing this blog post is, in a way, my way of trying to let that time go.</p>
