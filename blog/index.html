<b>NOTE:</b> This post is a component of a larger reflection blog post on my
time as an instructor for CMU's 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming
course. That blog post can be found <a href="https://brandonspark.github.io/blog/teaching">here</a>.
</p>
<hr style="clear: both;"/>
<p>Designing a course from scratch is a lot of effort. It involves creating a
itinerary of topics, a comprehensive narrative that drives the material,
homework assignments that will be challenging enough to nurture students' growth
while remaining feasible, and a great deal of investment into each individual
student.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">this blog post is not about that</span>. Having finished my
stint as a summer instructor for 15-150, the introductory functional programming
class at CMU, I was able to work off of course material that had already been
taught for years. There was no need for me to design a whole curriculum from
scratch.</p>
<p>But, even though the pure information content of the course was predetermined,
an important lesson that we derive from the film <em>Megamind</em> is that there is one
aspect which separates an <a href="https://youtu.be/dy2zB8bLSpk?si=HIk3h5GBnntdS_DF">instructor from a super-instructor</a>:</p>
<img src="&#x2F;presentation.jpg" class="center blog-image" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"/><!-- presentation -->
<p>With information comes the <em>presentation</em> of that information, and with
presentation comes stylistic choices. With those comes a whole other world of
issues and challenges, because information may be immutable, but how it is
conveyed to someone can make a world of difference in how it is retained,
remembered, and understood.</p>
<p>This blog post is about <strong><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">designing</span></strong> a course, in the sense of
artistic design. It's an exploration of how, over twelve weeks and months of
preparation, I attempted to create a comprehensive style that could not just
present material to students, but engage their attention fully, primarily
through the creation of visual content for students to refer back to in the form
of slides.</p>

            <!-- I have a ridiculous notion that elevators and phone booths are fundamentally the same.

In the obvious ways, they are reminiscent. Both are metal rectangular cages that people
enter and exit. The fundamental difference between them seems to be one of function--one
is for movement, and one is for communication. This is where most people would find the
analogy to be suspect.

But in certain ways, they emulate each other. A person walking into an elevator expects
to walk out with everything around them having changed. Some phone booths, people can
walk into and walk out of with nothing really being significantly different.

But on some days, you walk into a phone booth and emerge a completely different person.
Some days, you exit with the entire universe having changed, even if physically in the
same location.

<p>I found myself in a cramped, unventilated phone booth when my dreams came true.</p>
<p>The bare WeWork call booth was dimly lit by my laptop, which displayed a
Zoom waiting room. My leg bounced incessantly, mimicking the race of my heart.
My mother had told me to stop doing that.</p>
<p>I was moments away from a meeting with a professor from Carnegie Mellon's School
of Computer Science, to discuss my potential appointment as the summer instructor
for 15-150, Principles of Functional Programming. At only 23 years old, I had
only had a few job interviews in my life, and I felt woefully unprepared.</p>
