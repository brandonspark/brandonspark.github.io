In this lecture, we went backwards to review every single lecture that has
occurred in the course so far. While this was meant to be review material for
the upcoming final exam, it was also equally meant to clarify the goals and
high-level takeaways from each lesson.

We then discussed the course themes, the three theses that were established at
the beginning of the course, and ideas that have been continuously cropping up
over the tenure of the course. Mostly, this was a look at whether or not the
promises laid down at the beginning of the course were kept, and reinforcing
those ideas by examining them in context of what we now know about functional
programming.

The end of this lecture served as a personal send off for myself, to all of
my students, 150, and CMU in general. I thanked many of my influences and people
who inspired me to teach this course, and clarified some lessons that I learned
from the course, as well as what I wanted students to take away from it.

I hope you got something out of this course as well.
