In keeping with my fellow CMU alumni, I feel obligated to write down a
record and review of each semester of courses that I took while I was
an undergraduate, because I have frighteningly little personality
outside of my education.

Here, I am using colors to signify classes that I thought were particularly
noteworthy. Colored in {{ green(s="green") }} will be classes that I thought were
particularly thought-provoking or well-taught. Colored in {{
magenta(s="magenta") }} will be classes that I thought were life-changing.

This semester was a whirlwind of adjusting to college life, having things to do
outside of video games in my free time, and learning how to learn. In
retrospect, the workload was far less than what I would become used to later,
but my ability to take on more increased exponentially over the course of this
first year.

I had never done proof-based mathematics before, so Concepts gets the credit here
for introducing me to aspects of math that I didn't know existed. While everything
I was learning was hard, I was also loving the fact that I was learning things that
I thought were cool and interesting, which I never really got in high school.

I definitely also learned a lot from 122, but most of it was just getting
practice with programming, and practice with actually thinking while
programming. As an introductory course, it was pretty good, but I don't think it
was noteworthy enough for a special mention.

Generally, the other classes were chores that I tried to get done quickly so I could
focus on other things. I appreciated Ricky Law's enthusiasm for 79-104 a lot, though.

{{ emph(s="Extracurriculars") }}: A cappella

I found this semester a lot less cohesive than the last, because it
seemed like my attention was fragmented between many unrelated things,
whereas the previous semester just felt like a fundamental core, plus
a few extra things. In terms of my internal storyboard, this matters.

I have some scattered thoughts:
- 150 gets the position as one of the few CS courses I took where I did not fall
asleep most lectures. I found it very interesting to be learning something which
was a brand new paradigm that I had never seen before, and it tickled a part of
my brain which was looking for elegance and beauty, that I began to nurture over
the course of the next few years.
- Writing about Public Problems was an unexpectedly good course, where I felt like
I could write about something which actually mattered. Unfortunately, it was
only a half-semester course, and by "unexpectedly good", I just mean that I
spent only a moderate amount of time completing things haphazardly, rather than
most of the time.
- I took 381 expecting AI to be something that I would be good at, or enjoy, due
to being a cognitive science major interested in computer science. I found that
neither of those things were true, unfortunately.
- Cognitive Modeling was interesting, but it's where I first began to experience
dissonance with cognitive science, because it felt to me like there should be
something more principled than just fine tuning parameters to get models to
produce marginally human behavior. I began to get quite weary of experimental
results and approximations -- I wanted something more fundamental.

# {{ purple(s="(Freshman) Summer 2019") }}

This summer, I worked in the HoltLab and Lab in Multisensory Neuroscience, under
Dr. Neeraj Sharma (under Profs. Barbara Shinn-Cunningham and Lori Holt).

This summer, I was working using machine learning to classify EEG data, and
I worked on an autoencoder to try and capture the essential features for that
classification task. I learned a lot about practically using machine learning
libraries in Python, signal processing, and principal components analysis.

I think every waking moment I spent this semester was running to and from 213
labs, 251 problem sets, and 150 commitments. I spent many evenings in 251 office
hours. I would not recommend taking both of these courses together.

Despite the fact that I had almost no free time, I thought that both classes
were extremely interesting, and only cemented my interest in computer science
further. I think this is the semester where I began to realize that I could
really pursue computer science, that it was something that was within my
ability.

In addition, this was the first semester where I started TAing! 150 was a great
time, and it was when I started to meet people outside of my friends from
freshman year and Discord. Overall, I experienced a great tonal shift this
semester, in terms of my own self-image.

{{ emph(s="Extracurriculars") }}: Alpha Epsilon Pi, TA for 15-150, a cappella

This semester was the first semester of COVID, so there was an abrupt shift in
this semester, and towards the latter half I definitely stopped caring as much
about school.

- Students tend to fall into a bucket of enjoying 213 or 210, and to my surprise,
given that 210 was in SML, I was in the 213 bucket. It was a fine class, but I
had better things to do, and I'm not very good at coming up with algorithms, it
turns out.
- I was very excited about complexity theory, but I thought we spent too long on
some topics, and while some other students could appreciate Klaus' detours into
CDM-level math, I was not one such student, so I learned that the latter half of
every lecture, I could pretty much not understand.
- Experimental physics also was unbearable for me, I hate experiments
(Anderson was great though).
- Mor Harchol-Balter is great, and so is PNC. I don't enjoy probability (or math
involving numbers) very much, but she has a way of engaging the audience that I
found very compelling. I didn't get any chocolate, but I have lots of fond memories
of the course.

This was the semester where I completed my transfer into computer science. It was
a great weight off my shoulders to realize that I was finally free to study
the things that I wanted to study.

# {{ purple(s="(Sophomore) Summer 2020") }}

This was the first summer of COVID, so while I had an internship at IBM, I ended up
doing it remotely back home for the whole summer. This, put simply, kind of sucked.
I also got a project which was not particularly interesting to me, since it was a
rehash of a 213 assignment (ProxyLab) in C, and I at no point wrote code which anyone
actually tested, I'm pretty sure.

In addition, I TA'd for 150 and 213 this summer. Originally, the plan was that since
150 was a half-summer course, I would TA 150 for one half and 213 for the other.
Unfortunately, nobody actually _stopped_ me from TAing for both, so I ended up
juggling my internship, TAing for 150, and TAing for 213. This meant some days
I was in office hours for four hours straight. I would not recommend this.

This was also the summer I wrote SML Help (most of it).

# {{ purple(s="(Junior) Fall 2020") }}

- {{ magenta(s="15-312: Foundations of Programming Languages") }}
- 15-317: Constructive Logic
- {{ green(s="15-459: Quantum Computation") }}
- 21-373: Algebraic Structures
- 80-413: Category Theory

{{ emph(s="Extracurriculars") }}: Head TA for 15-150

There is precisely one class on this entire list that I felt was deserving of life-changing,
and that is 15-312. I thought about whether 15-150 should be one, but I only really began
to appreciate and understand 150 after I took it, while I was TAing, so I wouldn't have
said it changed my life as I was taking it.

15-312 changed my life as I was taking it. Bob Harper's teaching style was so amazingly
infectious and exciting that, after semesters of being at CMU, I felt like I was finally
understood. This class showed me exactly the fundamentals I was looking for, with all
the elegance and beauty that I wanted. I could not think about programming languages
the same way, after this course. I can recommend no other course more highly.

This was probably my favorite semester, academically speaking, at CMU. After a few
semesters of TAing 150, I had begun to learn snippets and whispers of the programming
language theory that it hinted at, and this semester I decided to go all in. Bob Harper
has an idea of "computational trinitarianism", comprised of logic, computer science, and
math. This was my computational trinitarinism semester. Every class, I felt like I learned
something which only peeled the curtain of reality back further, and everything was
wonderfully interconnected.

- Clogic was a pretty interesting class, but it annoyed me that there were so
  many people taking the course purely for the requirement, whereas I was there
  because of my interest. I felt like the course could have been more in-depth
  if not for that.
- Algebraic structures was terrible, and I could have learned an equivalent amount
  purely out of reading Dummit & Foote.
- Category theory was very interesting, albeit a little too abstract for me. I
  think I would have gotten more appreciation had it been taught with more of the
  computer science perspective in mind, as I did not have enough background math
  knowledge to really appreciate it.
- Quantum computation was unrelated to all the PL stuff, but it was actually a
  great course too -- Ryan O'Donnell is a terrific professor. While I am certain I
  will use none of the information I learned in this course again in my life, it
  was a lot of fun.

- 15-819: Computational Type Theory

- 80-514: Categorical Logic

{{ emph(s="Extracurriculars") }}: Head TA for 15-150

This is the beginning of the end, for my CS education, because this is the last semester
where I took a significant load. At this point, courses were still remote, for the most
part, and after the excitement of the previous semester, this selection of courses just
couldn't measure up. I spent most of this semester procrastinating and burning out of
my ability to do coursework.

- Bob's grad class was great, but unfortunately due to my lack of motivation, I didn't
  do most of the homeworks. This had the unfortunate effect of ensuring that I learned very
  little from the class, which was not Bob's fault.
- I also found categorical logic rather
  uninteresting, because I wanted something that was more based in the computer science
  aspects of category theory.
- Optimizing Compilers would have been a better course, were I not to be so burned out.
  Unfortunately, the prospect of working on C++ fatigued me quite a bit, and I felt like
  the class was more of an algorithms class than the compilers part.
- 451 was fun at times, but only because there were leaderboards for the fastest submission
  to solve a certain problem, and I took it as a personal challenge to try to beat as many
  people as possible with SML. I think I got top 10 at one point. Otherwise, it was a little
  too theoretical for me at times.
- CS Pedagogy was something I was interested in, but unfortunately I found it to not
  quite match up to what I was looking for. The course was mainly focused on content
  creation for CS Academy, and while we had a few fun seminars where we discussed
  pedagogical topics, those were rare occasions. I was moreso looking for something
  where we could discuss/learn more science-based techniques to pedagogy.

# {{ purple(s="(Junior) Summer 2021") }}

This summer, I was an intern at Facebook (then called Facebook), working on the Pyre
team, which is a Python type-checker written in OCaml. I'm pretty sure for the team
selection form I made it very clear I wanted to work on something functional, and I am
very glad that it ended up happening.

I thought this was a great summer. For one thing, although it was still remote, I was
able to get corporate housing, which meant I didn't need to be at home. The housing
was in Emeryville, and no one lives in Emeryville, to be fair, but it was nice to be
in California nonetheless.

I learned a lot about software engineering this summer, and I think this was the most
essential thing for my career after college, that I had already had experience with PRs
and Git and writing production OCaml. My project had to do with implementing shape types
for tensors, so that shape mismatches could statically be caught by Pyre, which I thought
was super cool. At one point, I got to present my work to Guido van Rossum himself!

{{ emph(s="Extracurriculars") }}: TA for 15-312, Vice President for AEPi, StuCo instructor (x2)

This semester, I became Vice President for AEPi, and started doing that as basically a
full-time job. Compilers was definitely an interesting course, albeit one whose 8am
lectures I could not possibly wake up in time for, and I enjoyed doing the homeworks
(and working in OCaml) quite a bit.

I started doing a senior thesis this semester, but I ultimately ended up dropping it
by the spring. I'd spent quite a bit of time debating about whether or not I should go
to the industry, or pursue academia, and I came to realize that research is just not
something that I enjoy doing.

{{ emph(s="Extracurriculars") }}: TA for 15-150, Vice President for AEPi, Greek Sing, StuCo instructor (x2)

I pretty much took a single class this semester, and focused on Greek Sing for
the rest of it. Sorry to say that I don't really have much to say, here. I found program
analysis really quite dry, and spending four weeks on dataflow analysis was a surefire way
to get me to mentally check out of the class completely.
