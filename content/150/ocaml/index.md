People are often skeptical of the usefulness of 150, due to the fact that
the SML language is not a language that is ever really used in any industrial
context.

While there are a great deal more rebuttals I could give to that line of
thinking, one fact remains, which is that **students of 15-150 effectively know
another language automatically**. That is the OCaml language, which resembles SML
greatly, and is used for various real-world applications.

This lecture goes into the differences between SML and OCaml, and the reasons
why OCaml can be a nicer language to work with. It aims to bring a student up
to speed with being able to program in OCaml at a similar level.
