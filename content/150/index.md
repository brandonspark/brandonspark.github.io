# {{ purple(s="Introduction") }}

I had the pleasure of serving as the summer instructor for 15-150, the introduction
functional programming class for computer science students at Carnegie Mellon, in
the Summer 2023 semester.

This course typically serves as the second or third course in the traditional
computer science undergraduate sequence, a privilege which not many other universities
get to enjoy, as functional programming is often considered a niche topic.

Despite this, I (and CMU) believe this to be of the utmost importance. A {{ emph(s="disciplined,
type-oriented, safety-first") }} view of programming can be of utmost benefit to burgeoning
computer science scholars, and I have often heard feedback from students that it is has
a transformative view on their perspective of computer science in general.

To that end, I have made my lecture materials from my iteration of the course {{ emph(s="available
for free on the Internet") }}. Please feel free to use this knowledge in any way that you see
fit, and I hope that it aids you in your future endeavors.
