<p>Hi there! As mentioned on the home page, my name is <strong>Brandon Wu</strong>, and I work as
a program analysis engineer at a company called
<span style="color:rgb(85, 238, 151)">Semgrep</span>, to profoundly improve
the future of software security.</p>
<p>I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022 with a degree in <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">computer science</span> and a <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">concentration in programming
languages</span>, and my interests include functional programming and things
related to functional programming.</p>
<p>When I'm not working or teaching (which is not terribly often), I like playing
guitar, listening to musical theater, and consuming content from the Marvel
Cinematic Universe.</p>
<h2 id=""><span style="color:#8869df">Academic Interests</span></h2>
<p>Academically, I am interested in programming languages, type theory, compilers,
and functional programming. I enjoy elegant and beautiful code, and I believe
that functional programming allows you to express ideas in terse, clear, and
aesthetically pleasing ways. At one point in my life I thought about doing a
Ph.D., but I never really enjoyed research or reading papers, so I went to
the industry instead.</p>
<p>My favorite languages include <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">OCaml</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Standard ML</span>,
and that's pretty much it. I have a middling understanding of other languages,
but for any problem that I am interested in solving, I would rather do it in
OCaml than really any other alternative, at this point in my career. I have
long-term ambitions to one day actually pick up Haskell and Scala for some reason,
but as of now I have not done so.</p>
<p>I think that there is nothing cooler or more interesting than writing code
which works on programs. Compilers, static analysis, and developer tooling
are all use cases that I am very interested in, and I intend to take
advantage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-employment_theorem#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%20and%20mathematics,by%20some%20class%20of%20professionals.">full employment theorem</a> for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I also think that writing parsers is fun, contrary to the popular belief of
many of my peers. It's like a nice, relaxing sudoku puzzle.</p>
<h2 id="-1"><span style="color:#8869df">Music</span></h2>
<p>I listen to a lot of musical theatre, which is not a fact I am normally proud to
disclose, but if anything's to go on the personal website, this is it. I tend
to enjoy more contemporary musicals that are in recent pop culture, so a list
of my top three would probably be:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Come From Away</span></li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Beetlejuice</span></li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Six</span></li>
</ol>
<p>but honorable mentions include Hamilton, Book of Mormon, and the Lightning
Thief Musical. I used to be a lot more into Dear Evan Hansen, but I think I've
outgrown it, for the most part.</p>
<p>Since I graduated college, I've been gradually transitioning away from musical
theatre, and now I listen to more varied stuff, though mostly pop music. I am
a big fan of an indie band called Bug Hunter, Bo Burnham, Olivia Rodrigo,
Taylor Swift, and myriad other random singles.</p>
<h2 id="-2"><span style="color:#8869df">Books</span></h2>
<p>I tend to enjoy re-reading things, and the activation energy to start something
new is rather high. Here's some books and other works that I've enjoyed quite
a bit though, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Worm</span>, by Wildbow</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Ra</span>, by qntm</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">The Mistborn Trilogy</span>, by Brandon Sanderson
<ul>
<li>Relatedly, <span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">The Stormlight Archive</span>, by Brandon Sanderson</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</span>, by Douglas Hofstadter</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race</span>, by Nicole Perlroth</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this list will expand in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="-3"><span style="color:#8869df">Video Games</span></h2>
<p>I used to play far too many video games when I was younger, and now I don't really
play them at all. Here's some I enjoyed a lot, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">League of Legends</span> - I played this game for about four years,
and the maximum rank I ever attained was Diamond V. When I was in high school,
I used to run an organization called Ascension eSports, which organized tournaments
for amateur competitive play, which is where I first started teaching, as a team
coach.</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Final Fantasy XV</span> - I went through a phase where I consumed all
media related to Final Fantasy XV for a period of about a year, when I was in
high school. I think it's a fantastic tragedy and a beautiful game, executed
very stylishly, and to an amazing soundtrack.</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Bioshock Infinite</span> - This one has a similar story, for me, as
Final Fantasy XV, though a few years later. I fully believe in video games as
an art form, and I think the story of Bioshock Infinite is emotionally charged,
philosophically compelling, and ultimately a masterpiece of storytelling through
gaming.</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 179, 48)">Darkest Dungeon</span> - I have a fair amount of fondness for roguelikes,
and Darkest Dungeon is one of my favorites. I think it hits the jackpot for how
its aesthetics synthesize with its gameplay, to create an immersively brutal
campaign with a satisfying (if enraging) gameplay loop. I have never once in many
hours of playing this game beat the Darkest Dungeon.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of games that I want to play grows ever larger with every passing year,
and although I tell myself eventually I will get around to it, the list of things
I need to accomplish in other domains of my life also grows ever larger.</p>
